# NOTE: Constants can be adjusted as needed over time, though depending on implementation changes may result in brief downtime while the database recalculates ("docker-compose run django python manage.py recalculate_ratings"). Default values are provided for reference.

# amusingly, there is no consensus whether "yeses" or "yesses" is the correct plural of "yes" but "yeses" is preferable
